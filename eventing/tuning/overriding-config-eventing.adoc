=  Overriding Knative Eventing system deployment configurations
:context: overriding-config-eventing

toc::[]

You can override the default configurations for some specific deployments by modifying the `workloads` spec in the `KnativeEventing` custom resource (CR). Currently, overriding default configuration settings is supported for the `eventing-controller`, `eventing-webhook`, and `imc-controller` fields, as well as for the `readiness` and `liveness` fields for probes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `replicas` spec cannot override the number of replicas for deployments that use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), and does not work for the `eventing-webhook` deployment.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can only override probes that are defined in the deployment by default.
