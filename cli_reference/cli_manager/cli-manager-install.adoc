//Brief explanation of what the cli manager is.
You can run the {cli-manager} in both connected and disconnected environments. In particular, it eases the installation and management of CLI plugins in disconnected environments. The {cli-manager} makes Krew compatible with the `oc` CLI. Cluster administrators can use the {cli-manager} to add CLI plugin custom resources that can then be accessed in both connected and disconnected environments. Cluster administrators install and configure the {cli-manager}, and users then add the custom index to Krew and add CLI plugins to the {cli-manager}.
