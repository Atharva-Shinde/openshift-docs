//Conceptual information that is needed for users moving from 2.x to 3, and for new users to understand and orient themselves OSSM 3.x.
//Customers who are using 3.O TP1 have expressed a need for this content.
//Did not like calling it "Service Mesh Concepts", though not sold on "Understanding Service Mesh" but like it better than "Service Mesh concepts".
//TP1 content so likely all info architecture, content, etc will change by GA
//Kiali attributes are influx

{SMProductName} is composed of two parts:

* {SMProductName} resources
* Kiali provided by Red Hat

Kali provided by Red Hat is composed of three parts:

* {KialiProduct}
* Kiali Server
* {SMPlugin}

{SMProduct} integrates with the following:

* Observability components such as:
** OpenShift Monitoring
** {DTProductname}
** {OTELOperator}
* cert-manager
* Argo rollouts
// * Integration of {SMProduct} with 3rd party components that support community Istio integrations --> commented out as none are currently documented in prod docs that are not supported by Red Hat, but support may change for GA so leaving as place holder.
