== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].

// Copied from OCP core file: making-open-source-more-inclusive.adoc
// Will make inclusive statement its own module for OSSM 3.0 GA.

// This is OSSM 3.0 TP 1 content. Technology Preview banner is persistent and was handled by a separate PR from Tim O'Keefe. It has also been added to rel notes so users will see it twice: once at the top of the page, and again within rel notes. OCP writers suggested it should appear in rel notes, even if it means the user sees it twice.
// NOTE: the banner does not appear in preview. You can see it here: https://docs.openshift.com/service-mesh/3.0.0tp1/about/ossm-about-openshift-service-mesh.html
// Content may change, file names may change, directories may change, the order of directories may change, everything may change for OSSM 3.0 GA.
