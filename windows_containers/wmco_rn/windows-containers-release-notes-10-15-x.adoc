The release notes for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Windows Machine Config Operator numbering

Starting with this release, y-stream releases of the WMCO will be in step with {product-title}, with only z-stream releases between {product-title} releases. The WMCO numbering reflects the associated {product-title} version in the y-stream position. For example, the current release of WMCO is associated with {product-title} version 4.15. Thus, the numbering is WMCO 10.15.z.

== Release notes for Red{nbsp}Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.15.3

This release of the WMCO provides new features and bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.15.3 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata//RHSA-2024:5745[RHSA-2024:5745].

=== Bug fixes

// Previously reviewed for WMCO 4.16
* Previously, after rotating the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-client-ca certificate`, the contents of the `kubetl-ca.crt file` on Windows nodes was not populated correctly. With this fix, after certificate rotation, the `kubetl-ca.crt` file contains the correct certificates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33875[*OCPBUGS-33875*])

* Previously, if reverse DNS lookup failed due to an error, such as the reverse DNS lookup services being unavailable, the WMCO would not fall back to using the VM hostname to determine if a certificate signing requests (CSR) should be approved. As a consequence, Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows nodes configured with an IP address would not become available. With this fix, BYOH nodes are properly added if reverse DNS is not available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37533[*OCPBUGS-37533*])

* Previously, if there were multiple service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace, the scaling of Windows nodes would fail. With this fix, the WMCO uses only the secret it creates, ignoring any other service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace. As a result, Windows nodes scale properly.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38485[*OCPBUGS-38485*])
