You can configure resource limits and requests for the following core platform monitoring components:

* Alertmanager
* kube-state-metrics
* monitoring-plugin
* node-exporter
* openshift-state-metrics
* Prometheus
* Metrics Server
* Prometheus Operator and its admission webhook service
* Telemeter Client
* Thanos Querier
// end::CPM[]

// tag::UWM[]
You can configure resource limits and requests for the following components that monitor user-defined projects:

* Alertmanager
* Prometheus
* Thanos Ruler
// end::UWM[]

By defining resource limits, you limit a container's resource usage, which prevents the container from exceeding the specified maximum values for CPU and memory resources.

By defining resource requests, you specify that a container can be scheduled only on a node that has enough CPU and memory resources available to match the requested resources.
