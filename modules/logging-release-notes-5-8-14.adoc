== Bug fixes

* Before this update, it was possible to set the `.containerLimit.maxRecordsPerSecond` parameter in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource to `0`, which could lead to an exception during Vector's startup. With this update, the configuration is validated before being applied, and any invalid values (less than or equal to zero) are rejected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4671[LOG-4671])

* Before this update, the Loki Operator did not automatically add the default `namespace` label to all its alerting rules, which caused Alertmanager instance for user-defined projects to skip routing such alerts. With this update, all alerting and recording rules have the `namespace` label and Alertmanager now routes these alerts correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6182[LOG-6182])

* Before this update, the LokiStack ruler component view was not properly initialized, which caused the invalid field error when the ruler component was disabled. With this update, the issue is resolved by the component view being initialized with an empty value. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6184[LOG-6184])
