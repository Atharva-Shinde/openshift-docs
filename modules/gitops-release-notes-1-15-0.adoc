[id="removal-of-application-manager-cli-kam_{context}"]
=== Removal of {gitops-title} Application Manager CLI, kam

* With this release, support for the {gitops-title} Application Manager command-line interface (CLI), `kam`, has been removed because this feature is no longer supported. As a result, all instances of `kam` have been removed from the {gitops-title} documentation. As an alternative to `kam`, you can use the Argo CD CLI that is available from {gitops-title} Operator v1.12.
