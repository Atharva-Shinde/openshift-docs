Part of {openshift-networking}, OpenShift SDN is a network plugin that uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a unified cluster network that enables communication between pods across the {product-title} cluster. This pod network is established and maintained by OpenShift SDN, which configures an overlay network by using Open vSwitch (OVS).

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a cloud controller manager (CCM) with the `--cloud-provider=external` option set to `cloud-provider-vsphere`, a known issue exists for a cluster that operates in a networking environment with multiple subnets. 

When you upgrade your cluster from {product-title} 4.12 to {product-title} {product-version}, the CCM selects a wrong node IP address and this operation generates an error message in the `namespaces/openshift-cloud-controller-manager/pods/vsphere-cloud-controller-manager` logs. The error message indicates a mismatch with the node IP address and the `vsphere-cloud-controller-manager` pod IP address in your cluster.

The known issue might not impact the cluster upgrade operation, but you can set the correct IP address in both the `nodeNetworking.external.networkSubnetCidr` and the `nodeNetworking.internal.networkSubnetCidr` parameters for the `nodeNetworking` object that your cluster uses for its networking requirements.
