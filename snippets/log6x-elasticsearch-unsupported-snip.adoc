[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.16, the Elasticsearch Operator is only supported for ServiceMesh, Tracing, and Kiali. This Operator is planned for removal from the OpenShift Operator Catalog in November 2025. The reason for removal is that the Elasticsearch Operator is no longer supported for log storage, and Kibana is no longer supported in {product-title} 4.16 and later versions. For more information on lifecycle dates, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators#platform-agnostic[Platform Agnostic Operators].
